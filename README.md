# HighLow
High/Low is a simple, turn-based two player online betting game in which each player, after choosing a desired betting amount, must choose between the “High” or “Low” portion of a deck of cards to bet on. The deck for High/Low contains 50 numbers where 1-25 are considered “Low” numbers and 26-50 are considered “High” numbers. After betting on the desired portion of the deck, the player will be dealt a random card containing a number from 1-50, and depending on their bet, will win or lose an equivalent amount of money to their bet meaning the game pays 1:1. The first player to run out of money will automatically forfeit the game otherwise, the first player to reach a net worth of $15,000 or more will win the game.
